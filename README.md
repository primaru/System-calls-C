# System-calls-C
This repo contains 3 projects/assignments (named a1,a2,a3) I've done  in C language for the "Operating Systems" course which use ONLY software calls (not higher end functions) for creating programs that use concepts like mutex / locks / semaphors, multi-threading and parallelization of a C program. Every assignment was graded either 10 or very close (somewhere around 9.8) by the tester.
